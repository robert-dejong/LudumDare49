Entry for Ludum Dare 49 (October 2021)

The entire game was created within the weekend of 2-3 october 2021.

# Instructions
You are walking home after a night of heavy drinking, how far can you get without getting hit by a car or dying from stepping into broken glass?

Controls:

Arrow up/down: Moves the player up/down.

You can turn the double vision effect off in the main menu if it’s annoying.


Goal:

Try to walk as far as possible without dying. 
Picking up beer along the way will heal you. 
The game gets increasingly difficult the longer you survive, feel free to post your hiscores in the comments, mine so far has been about 9000.


How to play:

This game requires Java to be installed. It was made using JRE 1.8.
Most of you should be able to just run the JAR file to launch the game. If this for some reason doesn’t work you can try using the backup_run.bat provided with the Windows download.

# Installation
The game was made using Eclipse. After cloning the repository you should be able to open the project in Eclipse.
