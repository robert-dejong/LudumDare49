Unstable bridge:
	- Drive across an endless(?) bridge slowly tearing apart
	- Parts of the bridge in front of the player starts cracking and tearing off, the player has to maneuver around to prevent falling off the bridge
	- Powerups?
	- Highscores? Local/online?
	- Buy different cars with scores / cash found during gameplay -> Requires savefile
		- Only cosmetic or with benefits?
		
	Pros:
		- Relatively easy to create sprites for
		
	Cons:
		- Plain


Drunk bum:
	- Player is wasted and has to try to walk home
		- Player automatically sways to simulate drunkenness? Might be annoying
		- Camera sways? Sounds extremely annoying
		- Doublevision effect? World partly renders double with a transparancy effect applied -> POC required?
	- Avoid obstacles? Fires, used needles, people?
	- Powerups, hiscores?
	
	Pros:
		- Silly
		- More interesting environment
		
	Cons:
		- Difficult to create sprites for
		

TODO:
- Setting to turn drunkenness effect off and/or reduce it
